  <LI> <B>Shared/switched ethernet:</B> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE> 
      <P><B>- shared ethernet: </B>traditionally, ethernet has been a shared media, 
        with all users on a subnet sharing the bandwidth available on that circuit. 
        Cost-effective, but a poor choice for high-performance connections.</P>
      <P> <B>- switched ethernet: </B>Connections that dedicate the full capacity 
        of a connection to a particular workstation or server, and limit the traffic 
        sent to a particular host to traffic that is destined for, or coming from, 
        that host. Switched ethernet is normally how high-performance systems 
        will connect to UOnet. </P>

  <LI><B>Half duplex/full duplex:</B> 
    <BLOCKQUOTE> 
      <P> <B>- half duplex:</B> on a half duplex connection, a connection talks 
        or listens, but doesn't do both at the same time. </P>
      <P><B>- full duplex:</B> on a full duplex connection, a workstation or server 
        can simultaneously transmit and receive data. </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <LI><B>FDDI: </B>an older 100 megabit-per-second competitor to fast ethernet. 
    See a comparison of FDDI and Fast Ethernet at <A href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/729/c5000/swfet_wp.htm">http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/729/c5000/swfet_wp.htm 
    </A> </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>ATM:</B> Asynchronous Transfer Mode. Circuit-switched (rather than packet-switched) 
    network technology that chops data into 53 byte cells. Often used for wide-area 
    high-performance connectivity. For an excellent ATM tutorial, see<A href="http://www.scan-technologies.com/tutorials/ATM%20Tutorial.htm"> 
    http://www.scan-technologies.com/tutorials/ATM%20Tutorial.htm </A> </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI> <B>SONET</B> <B>(and Packet Over SONET):</B> The alternative to ATM for 
    wide-area, high-performance connectivity via Abilene, and the option the UO 
    will be using. Quoting Cisco¹s Packet Over SONET whitepaper: &quot;For expensive 
    WAN links, Packet over SONET can provide as much as 25- to 30-percent higher 
    throughput than Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based networks. By transporting 
    frames directly into the SONET/SDH payload, the overhead required in ATM cell 
    header, IP over ATM encapsulation, and segmentation and reassembly (SAR) functionality 
    is eliminated.&quot; For the complete discussion, see <A href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/733/12000/gspos_an.htm">http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/733/12000/gspos_an.htm</A> 
    A general SONET tutorial is available at <A href="http://www.webproforum.com/tektronix/index.html">http://www.webproforum.com/tektronix/index.html 
    </A></LI>
  <P> 
  <LI> <B>WDM/DWDM: </B>Wave Division Multiplexing/Dense Wave Division Multiplexing. 
    The underlying technology allowing carriers with existing fiber to obtain 
    huge amounts of incremental bandwidth without having to pull additional fiber. 
    Allows a single strand of fiber to simultaneously carry multiple parallel 
    transmissions on different light wavelengths (&quot;lambdas&quot;). A good 
    WDM tutorial is available at <A href="http://www.webproforum.com/lucent3/">http://www.webproforum.com/lucent3/

  <P> 
  <LI><B>GSR:</B> Cisco's 12000-series Gigabit Switch Router, the special high-performance 
    router that many sites, including the UO, are using to connect to Abilene. 
    See <A href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/733/12000/gspos_an.htm">http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/733/12000/</A></LI>

  <P> 
  <LI> <B>Gigapop:</B> Gigabit point-of-presence. As originally envisioned, I2 
    sites would connect to the I2 backbone via a regional &quot;Gigapop.&quot; 
    Gigapops would combine the traffic from directly connected I2 member sites 
    and exchange it with other Gigapops via I2 backbone links. By aggregating 
    individual I2 sites behind Gigapops, the size of the I2 routing matrices can 
    be kept small and efficient, and network problems could be resolved via contact 
    between Gigapop NOCs. The Oregon Gigapop is located in Eugene and operated 
    by the UO. </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>POP</B> <B>(Point-of-Presence):</B> Location at which an internet service 
    provider connects to the Internet and offers local connections to customers, 
    whether via leased circuits or dialup connections. A small ISP might have 
    only one POP, while a national ISP might have a POP in virtually every major 
    metro area. </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>Exchange point </B>(also, &quot;meet point&quot;): A location where network 
    service providers can peer and exchange network traffic with each other. The 
    UO operates the Oregon Internet Exchange in Eugene (see <A href="http://antc.uoregon.edu/OREGON-EXCHANGE/">http://antc.uoregon.edu/OREGON-EXCHANGE/</A> 
    ) </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>Peering/Transit:</B> When two networks peer, they agree to cooperatively 
    exchange their network customers' traffic--and only their customers' traffic--typically 
    at no charge. These traffic exchanges take place at an exchange point. Contrast 
    peering with buying transit bandwidth from a network service provider: when 
    you buy transit bandwidth, the network service provider agrees to accept and 
    transfer traffic on your behalf to any other destination on the Internet, 
    whether it's for another customer of the NSP's or for a customer of some other 
    network service provider. </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>Meritorious/Commodity Traffic:</B> Meritorious traffic meets the Acceptable 
    Use Policy (AUP) adopted by a particular network. For example, I2's AUP limits 
    use of I2 to traffic destined for other I2 sites or comparable/approved research 
    and education networks. Other traffic, such as a mail message to an AOL user 
    or a web page from CNN's web site, would be considered &quot;commodity traffic&quot; 
    and would not be eligible to travel over I2. </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>NOC: </B>Network Operation Center. A NOC is a facility, typically staffed 
    24 hours a day/7 days a week, by NOC technicians who can monitor, detect and 
    arrange for a response to network problems. There's usually one NOC per network. 
  </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>Colocation:</B> While most networked companies or schools want to have 
    machines in their facilities connected to the Internet, some companies don't 
    really care where their servers are physically located. For example, a company¹s 
    main web server might just as easily live in a locked rack at an exchange 
    point as in a company office. Servers located at network service provider 
    facilities rather than at corporate or campus locations are said to be &quot;colocated&quot; 
    and are typically able to buy bandwidth for less than the cost of a traditional 
    Internet connection due to the elimination of local loop charges and reduced 
    equipment requirements for the network service provider. Colocation also typically 
    offers the server owner access to conditioned/uninterruptable power, improved 
    physical security, geographical flexibility in siting servers, etc. </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>Local Loop:</B> A synonym for &quot;local access circuits&quot; or the 
    physical wire or fiber optic cable that connects a site to their Network Service 
    Provider's POP. Local loops are typically purchased from the local phone company 
    or from a competitive local exchange carrier. For example, the UO buys its 
    local loops from USWest and Electric Lightwave (ELI). Local loop charges are 
    in addition to a network service provider's port charges. </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI> <B>Port Charge:</B> The payment made to a network service provider so they 
    will accept and transfer your transit traffic. Port charges are normally sized 
    according to the maximum capacity of the circuit to the network service provider. 
  </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B> Backhaul:</B> If a network service provider doesn¹t have sufficient 
    capacity (or required services) at a local POP, they may need to &quot;backhaul&quot; 
    a circuit you¹ve ordered to another better-equipped location, which adds to 
    the cost of obtaining that service (unless backhaul charges are waived). </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>IPv4/IPv6:</B> IP (also, ³IPv4²) is the Internet Protocol that underlies 
    virtually all Internet traffic today. A new version of the IP protocol, IPv6, 
    is on experimental use on the so-called 6Bone (see http://www.6bone.net/). 
    IPv6 access is an example of the sort of advanced services that Internet 2 
    will likely support. See the tutorial at http://www.6bone.net/case-for-ipv6.txt 
    or see http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/INET-IPng-Paper.html </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI>I<B>P multicast video: </B>With IP multicast, a single network video stream 
    services all viewers on a given network segment, rather than requiring separate 
    streams for each viewer. IP multicast scales well to virtually unlimited-sized 
    global audiences. Cisco¹s excellent IP multicast training materials are available 
    online at ftp://ftpeng.cisco.com/ipmulticast/ multicast_training.html An easy 
    way to begin using IP multicast is to install Cisco/Precept¹s IP/TV from the 
    UO Duckware CD-ROM, or see http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~joelja/project/mbone.html 
  </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B>QoS (Quality of Service):</B> There has been a lot of interest among 
    I2 participants in Quality of Service-related issues, or efforts to provide 
    better than ³best-efforts² access to Internet resources. For example, some 
    Internet applications (such as tele-surgery or remote management of a scientific 
    instrument) require bounds on latency and jitter, or a reserved amount of 
    bandwidth from end-to-end. An excellent series of papers are available at 
    <A href="http://www.internet2.edu/qos/may98Workshop/html/presentations.html">http://www.internet2.edu/qos/may98Workshop/html/presentations.html 
    </A></LI>
  <P> 
  <LI><B> Bandwidth and Latency: </B>Bandwidth can be considered the effective 
    rate at which bits are delivered from their source to their destination‹or 
    the &quot;size of the pipe&quot; between two sites. Latency is the delay a 
    packet experiences while being transmitted from its origin to its destination. 
    This is a crucial issue in high-performance networking because there is a 
    close relationship between packet latency and the maximum effective bandwidth 
    which a connection can sustain. See <A href="http://engr.ans.net/slides.html#nanog-feb-1997-tcp-congested">http://engr.ans.net/slides.html#nanog-feb-1997-tcp-congested 
    </A> </LI>
  <P> 
  <LI> <B>Jitter:</B> The variance in the time it takes for a packet to be transmitted 
    from its origin to its destination. Jitter is a problem in advanced applications 
    such as IP multicast video because even small deviations in delivery pacing 
    can translate into noticeable interruptions in otherwise smooth video delivery, 
    unless buffering or other similar techniques are employed. </LI>
