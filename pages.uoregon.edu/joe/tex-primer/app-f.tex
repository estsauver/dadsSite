\centerline{\twlbf APPENDIX F: Sample \TeX\ Landscape-Mode Overhead Made 
Using PostScript Fonts}
\bigskip\par\noindent
Because of the frequent interest in generating overheads for teaching and
dissertation-defense purposes, this appendix consists of output for a 
sample overhead built using \TeX{}.
\bigskip\par\noindent
In the context of showing how to make overheads, this example
also illustrates how to obtain landscape mode output and
how to use native PostScript fonts (such as Helvetica and 
Helvetica Bold).
\bigskip\par\noindent
A machine readable copy of the raw \TeX\ commands used to typeset 
that resume is available to OREGON VAX users as:
\bigskip\par\noindent\hglue 0.5truein
{\twltt TEX\$DISK:[TEX.SAMPLES]OVERHEAD2.TEX}
\bigskip\par\noindent
On other systems get a copy of that file via anonymous FTP. 
\bigskip\par\noindent
FTP to {\twltt DECOY.UOREGON.EDU (128.223.32.19)} and see directory 
{\twltt pub/tex/samples}.
