\centerline{\twlbf APPENDIX B: Complete Sample Technical \TeX\ Document}
\bigskip\bigskip\par\noindent
This appendix will eventually consist of \TeX\ output for 
``A Computationally Fast Implementation of Fisher's
Test of Difference-Score Population Symmetry About Zero.''
\bigskip\par\noindent
That manuscript has been submitted for publication in a 
statistical journal, however unanticipated delays in the publication
of the article prevent me from including a copy of 
it as Appendix B at this time.
\bigskip\par\noindent 
As soon as that article goes to press, a copy of the \TeX\ output and 
the commands used to generate it will be made available so that \TeX\ 
users can have a technical article (complete with equations) to use as
an example for their own technical articles.
\bigskip\par\noindent
I regret any inconvenience this unavoidable delay may cause.
