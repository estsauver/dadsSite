\centerline{\twlbf APPENDIX C: Sample U of O Thesis Pages from the ``Grey
Book''}
\bigskip\bigskip\par\noindent
This appendix consists of \TeX\ output representing sample U of O 
thesis pages taken from the {\twlit University of Oregon Style and Policy
Manual for Theses and Dissertations}, University of Oregon Graduate School,
revised September 1987.
\bigskip\par\noindent
A machine-readable copy of the raw \TeX\ commands used to typeset these 
pages is available to OREGON VAX users as:
\bigskip\par\noindent\hglue 0.5truein
{\twltt TEX\$DISK:[TEX.SAMPLES]UOTHESIS.TEX}
\bigskip\par\noindent
On other systems get a copy of that file via anonymous FTP.
\bigskip\par\noindent
FTP to {\twltt DECOY.UOREGON.EDU (128.223.32.19)} and see directory 
{\twltt pub/tex/samples}.
\bigskip\par\noindent
We've done our best to make these sample pages meet U of O Graduate School
requirements as outlined in the ``Grey Book,'' but in the final analysis,
{\twlbf you} are the one who has to please the Graduate School and your
committee, not us. 
\bigskip\par\noindent
We {\twlbf strongly} urge you to consult on an early and ongoing basis
with the Graduate School editor and your committee members for 
authoritative assistance in meeting dissertation content and format
requirements.
