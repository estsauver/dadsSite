%%% overhead.tex:
%%%   under the guise of showing how to create a typical overhead "slide",
%%%   this little example actually slides in illustrating landscape mode,
%%%   and use of PostScript fonts.  "God forgive me, I know not what I do."
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%
%%% rotate the overhead 90 degrees so the long axis is horizontal
\special{landscape}
%%%
%%% cancel pagenumbers since this is just a single overhead we're doing
\nopagenumbers
%%%
%%% adjust the default page size to something appropriate for landscape mode
\hsize=9in
\vsize=6.5in
%%%
%%% declare a couple of PostScript native fonts at overhead size dimensions
\font\thtyhvbld=Helvetica-Bold at 30pt
\font\thtyhv=Helvetica at 30pt
%%%
%%% make sure that our inter-line spacing is reasonable for those behemoths;
%%% note that the values I set might look terrible to you -- pick your own!
\normalbaselineskip=32pt

%%% okay, enough screwing around.  let's do it...
%%%
%%% our default font will be 30 pt Helvetica...
\thtyhv
%%% set up them tab stops...

%%% set the title of the overhead, then let's set the body of the table
\+{\thtyhvbld THE ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY MODEL}\cr
\bigskip\bigskip
\+--&EOQ minimizes total inventory costs\cr
\+&by balancing carrying and ordering costs\cr
\bigskip\bigskip
\+--&EOQ represents the solutions to the first\cr
\+&differential of the total cost function\cr
\bigskip\bigskip
\+--&EOQ assumes non-lumpy demand patterns,\cr
\+&instantaneous deliveries, known and constant\cr
\+&ordering and carrying costs, and no price\cr
\+&breaks.\cr
\bigskip\bigskip
\+--&If these assumptions aren't met, consider\cr
\+&using a more advanced technique such as\cr
\+&MRP II or the Wagner-Whitin Algorithm.\cr
